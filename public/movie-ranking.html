<h1>The Best Movies According to Anderson</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Interestellar</h3>

<p>This is one of the coolest science fiction movies in my opinion, because it is scientifically possible according to the people who made the movie and beacuse of the narrative it carries.</p>

<h3>Ready Player One</h3>

<p>I watched it when I was about 12 years old and I couldn't help but imagine how it would be if there was a game like that in real life.</p>

<h3>The Nightmare before Christmas</h3>

<p>Again a funny movie from my child life. I put it here for the reason that I can watch it no matter how many times, I'll still like it. By no means forgetting the opening song of the movie that I aways follow along when watching</p>
